        <h3>Responsible Authority</h3>
        The responsible authority for data processing on this website is: <br>
        <br>
        Christopher Zwick <br> 
        In der Schlage 38a <br> 
        58313 Herdecke <br>
        <br>
        Phone: +49 (0) 123 44 55 66 <br>
        Email: c.zwick@hotmail.de <br>
        <br>
        The responsible authority is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.). <br>
        <h3>Storage Period</h3>
        Unless a specific storage period is specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you request deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.
        <h3>General Information about the Legal Basis of Data Processing on this Website</h3>
        If you have given your consent to data processing, we will process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing will also take place on the basis of Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your terminal device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the processing of data will also take place on the basis of § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we will process your data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we will process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the respective legal bases can be found in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
        In the course of our business activities, we work with various external entities. It may be necessary to transfer personal data to these external entities. We only disclose personal data to external entities if it is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
        <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
        IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR). <br>
        <br>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.
        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
        <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.
        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases: <br>
        <br>
        - If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. <br>
        - If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion. <br>
        - If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion. <br>
        - If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. <br>
        - If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – apart from their storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state. <br>
        <h2>3. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
        <h3>Request via E-mail, Telephone, or Fax</h3>
        When you contact us by e-mail, telephone, or fax, your request including all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent. <br>
        <br>
        The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this was requested; the consent can be revoked at any time. <br>
        <br>
        The data you send us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular statutory retention periods – remain unaffected. <br>
